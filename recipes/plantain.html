    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        A plantain is a starchy, fruit-like vegetable,
         related to bananas but firmer, longer, and typically cooked before eating.
          It is a staple food in many tropical regions and can be boiled, fried, or baked and is used in both savory and sweet dishes.
           Plantains are a good source of carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, such as potassium and vitamin C.

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Peel the platains:</b>Cut off the ends and make a shallow, lengthwise slit along the skin. Peel the skin away using your fingers or a knife.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Slice:</b>Cut the peeled plantains diagonally into slices about 1/2-inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Heat Oil:</b>Pour enough oil (vegetable or canola) into a large skillet to cover the bottom by about 1/4 inch, and heat over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Fry:</b>Carefully add the plantain slices in a single layer, in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown and caramelized.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Drain:</b>Remove the fried plantains with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
        </li>
        <li> 
            <b>Serve:</b>Sprinkle with a little salt (optional) and serve immediately while warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
